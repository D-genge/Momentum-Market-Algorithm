# Momentum-Market-Algorithm
This python project was a personal project to explore market algorithms and their functionalities. The algorithm is momentum based which means predictions are made by stocks having steady/linear growth or decay. The algorithm implements the Yahoo Finance API to receive its data. Once all predictions are made each stock is given an equal prototion of money.
